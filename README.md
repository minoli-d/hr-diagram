# Hertzsprung Russell Diagram

The Hertzsprung Russell Diagram (H-R Diagram) is a diagram displaying the luminosity of stars against their temperature and is a key indicator of stellar evolution. Using the Hipparcos, Yale Bright Star and Gliese Catalogues to recreate this diagram, this visual representation of stellar evolution was analysed and interpreted. Additionally, H-R Diagrams that correspond to each individual galactic quadrant were also compared to reveal whether the location of a star has any effect on its life cycle. The paper analyses how the H-R Diagram is an indicator only to the age and phase of a star and its physical location in the spatial plane is not a deciding attribute to its evolution.
